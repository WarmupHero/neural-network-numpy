Comparison plots and short written analyses built from the experiment results.

Input: a full results JSON written by nn_from_scratch.modeling.train
(``reports/main_results_full_<stamp>.json``): a list with one dictionary per
training run, holding its settings (problem, architecture, optimizer,
learning rate, batch size, seed) and its loss histories and test metric.

Output (each file name gets the run stamp):
- in ``reports/figures/comparisons/``: loss-curve figures that compare runs
  differing in exactly one setting (optimizer, network depth, learning rate,
  A2 variant, dropout);
- in ``reports/comparisons/``: two text files (depth and learning-rate analyses) that say which run
  converged faster and which reached the lower final losses.

Run it with ``python -m nn_from_scratch.comparisons [results.json]``.
