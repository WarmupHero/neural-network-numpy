"""
Evaluation metrics reported for trained models.

The metrics reuse the training losses (BCELoss and MSELoss) so that the
reported numbers are directly comparable with the loss curves. Both
functions accept 1-D or column-vector inputs and return a plain float.

def binary_cross_entropy(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    Compute Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) as the classification evaluation metric.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, 1)
        True labels, 0 or 1. Converted to float64.
    y_pred : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, 1)
        Predicted probabilities from the network, usually the output
        of a sigmoid activation. Converted to float64. Must have the same
        number of elements as y_true.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Mean binary cross-entropy. Lower is better.

    Notes
    -----
    Processing:

    1. Convert both inputs to float64 NumPy arrays and reshape them to
       column vectors of shape (n_samples, 1).
    2. Compute the loss with BCELoss().forward, which clips the
       probabilities to avoid log(0).
    3. Convert the result to a Python float.

    The same BCE used as the training loss is used to evaluate the model,
    so the reported metric is directly comparable with the loss curves.

    It computes:
        -mean(y_true * log(y_pred) + (1 - y_true) * log(1 - y_pred))

    Reusing BCELoss keeps a single implementation (including the
    clipping that avoids log(0)).

    Parameters

        True target values. Converted to float64.
    y_pred : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, 1)

    Compute classification accuracy from predicted probabilities.

    Parameters
    ----------

        True labels, 0 or 1.
    y_prob : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, 1)
        Predicted probability of class 1 for each sample.
    threshold : float, default=0.5
        A sample is predicted as class 1 when its probability is at least
        this value.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Fraction of samples whose predicted class equals the true label,
        between 0 and 1. Higher is better.

    Notes
    -----
    Processing:

    1. Flatten both inputs to 1-D float64 arrays.
    2. Turn probabilities into class predictions: 1 if y_prob >= threshold,
       otherwise 0.
    3. Return the mean of (prediction == label).

    Accuracy is reported next to BCE because it is easier to read, but it
    ignores how confident each prediction was. BCE remains the metric used
    for training and model selection.

    Compute the coefficient of determination (R²) for regression.

    Parameters

        True target values.
    y_pred : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, 1)

    Returns
    -------
    float
        R² = 1 - SS_res / SS_tot. 1 is a perfect fit, 0 matches always
        predicting the mean of y_true, and negative values are worse than
        that. Higher is better.

    Notes
    -----
    Processing:

    1. Flatten both inputs to 1-D float64 arrays.
    2. SS_res = sum((y_true - y_pred)^2), the squared error of the model.

       predicting the mean of the same targets.
    4. Return 1 - SS_res / SS_tot.

    This is the textbook R², which uses the mean of the evaluated targets
    themselves. The "error removed" figure in the analysis instead compares
    against a constant fitted on the training set, so the two can differ
    slightly.
