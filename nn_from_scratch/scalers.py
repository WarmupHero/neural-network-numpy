"""
Feature scaling used during preprocessing.

Provides a from-scratch StandardScaler that learns per-column mean and
standard deviation on the training data and applies the same
transformation to any other split.

import numpy as np


class StandardScaler:
    """
    Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling by the standard deviation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    mean_ : numpy.ndarray of shape (n_features,), dtype float64, or None
        Feature-wise mean learned by fit(); None before fitting.
    std_ : numpy.ndarray of shape (n_features,), dtype float64, or None
        Feature-wise standard deviation learned by fit(), with zeros
        replaced by 1e-8; None before fitting.

    Notes
    -----
    Formula:

        X_scaled = (X - mean) / std

    This is done feature-by-feature, meaning each column is scaled separately.

    Why this is useful: standardization helps neural networks train more
    smoothly because

    - features are put on a similar scale
    - very large-valued features do not dominate smaller-valued ones
    - optimization is usually more stable

        Create an empty scaler.

        Parameters
        ----------
        None

        Returns
        -------
        None
            Sets self.mean_ and self.std_ to None until fit() is called.

        Notes

        Learn the feature-wise mean and standard deviation from the data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : numpy.ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_features), dtype float64
            Training data, one sample per row.

        Returns
        -------
        StandardScaler
            The same scaler object (self), now fitted, so calls can be
            chained as in fit(X).transform(X).

        Processing:

        1. Compute the mean of each column and store it in self.mean_.
        2. Compute the standard deviation of each column (population
           std, ddof=0) and store it in self.std_.
        3. Replace any zero standard deviation with 1e-8 to avoid
           division by zero later.

        axis=0 means:
        - compute one mean per column
        - compute one standard deviation per column

        So if X has shape (100, 4), then:
        - self.mean_ will have shape (4,)

        ----------

            Data to scale. n_features must match the data used in fit().

        Notes

           statistics across all rows.

        In a proper ML workflow:
