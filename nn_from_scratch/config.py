"""
Shared paths, the global random seed and run-stamp helpers.

Every other module imports its folder locations (project root, raw data,
reports and figures) and the default random seed from here. The folders
follow the Cookiecutter Data Science layout. This module also
creates the run stamp (a YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS time string) that is added to the
name of every output file, and provides helpers that find the newest
stamped output on disk so that downstream scripts (analysis, plots, the
git pre-commit tool) can read the most recent results.

    Insert a run stamp into a file name, just before the extension.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str
        A bare file name such as "main_summary.csv". It may also contain a
        folder part; only the text after the last dot is treated as the
        extension.
    stamp : str, default=RUN_STAMP
        Stamp to insert, in YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS format. The default is the stamp
        created when this module was first imported.

    -------
    str
        The stamped file name, for example "main_summary_20261007-153012.csv".
