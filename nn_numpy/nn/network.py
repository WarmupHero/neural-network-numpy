    A simple feed-forward neural network built as an ordered sequence

    This class is responsible for:
    - storing the network layers
    - running the full forward pass
    - running the full backward pass
    - returning trainable layers for optimization
    - building the architecture from a configuration

    Attributes
    ----------
    layers : list
        Layer objects (Dense, BatchNorm, activation, Dropout) in the order
        the data flows through them.
    random : numpy.random.RandomState
        Generator shared by all Dense layers for weight initialization.
    dropout_random : numpy.random.RandomState
        Separate generator shared by all Dropout layers for their masks.

    Notes
    -----
    - The loss function is handled separately in losses.py
    - Parameter updates are handled separately in optimizers.py
    - The network owns a single random number generator for weight
      initialization, so all layer initializations are reproducible but
      not identical. Dropout uses a second, separate generator.

        Parameters
        ----------
        None
            Uses `self.layers`.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            Prints one line per layer to standard output.

        Notes
        -----
        Processing:
        1. Print a header line.
        2. For each layer, print its 1-based position and class name.

        Example output:

            --- Network Architecture ---
            Layer 1: Dense
            Layer 2: ReLU
            Layer 3: Dense
            Layer 4: Sigmoid

        This is only a lightweight helper for inspection.
