Compare the from-scratch NumPy network with the library models.

Input:
- the newest ``reports/main_results_full_<stamp>.json`` (the NumPy network)
- the newest ``reports/benchmark_<library>_results_<stamp>.json`` for each
  library that has results (currently scikit-learn)

Output:
- ``reports/benchmark_report_<stamp>.txt``: comparison tables per task
- ``reports/figures/benchmarks/benchmark_<task>_<stamp>.png``: one bar
  chart per task

Every model is treated the same way: on each seed, the configuration with
the lowest validation metric is selected, and its test metric is reported.
Results are averaged over seeds (mean ± sample standard deviation).

Run it with ``python -m nn_from_scratch.benchmarks.report`` or
``make benchmark-report``.

def main(numpy_results_path=None):

    Build the comparison report and figures.

    Parameters
    ----------
    numpy_results_path : str or None, default=None
        A specific main_results_full_<stamp>.json. None uses the newest.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        Writes reports/benchmark_report_<stamp>.txt, one bar chart per
        problem and one learning-curve figure per framework, and prints
        their paths.

    Raises
    ------
    FileNotFoundError
        If no library has results yet, or no NumPy results file exists.

    Notes
    -----
    Processing:
    1. Load the NumPy network's results and each library's newest results.
    2. For each problem, build the rows, the table, the head-to-head lines,
       an architecture-by-architecture table per framework, and the bar
       chart.
    3. Plot the learning curves of the selected models per framework.
    4. Write the report with a header explaining the method and listing
       the input files.
