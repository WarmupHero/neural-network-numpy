"""
scikit-learn models for the library comparison.

Input: a model family name (e.g. "random_forest"), its hyperparameter grid
from ``configs/benchmark_experiments.json``, and one seed's data split.
Output: one result record per hyperparameter configuration, with the
validation, test and training metrics and the training time.

Every model is scored with the project's own NumPy metric functions
(``nn_from_scratch.nn.metrics``), not scikit-learn's, so the numbers are
computed exactly like the from-scratch network's.

    List every hyperparameter combination in a grid.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid : dict of str to list, or list of dict of str to list
        A parameter grid as written in the config: each key maps to a list
        of values to try. A list of such dicts is a union of grids (used
        when some parameters only make sense together).

    Returns
    -------
    list of dict
        One dict per combination. JSON lists inside values (such as
        hidden_layer_sizes [32, 32, 32]) are converted to tuples, which is
        what scikit-learn expects.

    Notes
    -----
    Processing:
    1. Expand the grid with scikit-learn's ParameterGrid, which forms the
       Cartesian product of each dict's value lists.
