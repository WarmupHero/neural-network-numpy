"""
Build the repository's knowledge base: an OWL 2 ontology for Protégé.

Input: the experiment configs (``configs/*.json``), the Python sources of
``nn_numpy/``, ``tools/`` and ``tests/`` (modules and their imports,
read with ``ast``), the ``Makefile`` (targets and the modules they run),
``pyproject.toml`` (libraries and versions), the raw datasets (row counts)
and the architecture canvas (node ids).
Output: ``knowledge/nn_numpy.owl`` in RDF/XML.

The ontology describes the repository as nodes and edges: modules,
packages, artifacts and make targets are individuals, and what each one
reads, writes, imports or belongs to is asserted. Pipeline order, stage
membership and the roles of modules and architectures are left for a
reasoner to infer (see the defined classes and property chains in
``add_schema``). Run it with ``python tools/build_knowledge_base.py`` or
``make knowledge-base``. Open the result in Protégé and start the reasoner.

The generated file is not meant to be edited by hand: put manual additions
in ``knowledge/extensions.owl``, which imports it.

    3. A blank node that heads an RDF list is written as
       rdf:parseType="Collection"; any other blank node is written as a
       nested typed element (owl:Restriction, owl:Class, rdfs:Datatype) or
       rdf:Description.

    rdflib's own RDF/XML writer nests named entities inside each other and
    can turn a blank node inside a collection into a named IRI, which would
    corrupt the class expressions; this writer avoids both.
