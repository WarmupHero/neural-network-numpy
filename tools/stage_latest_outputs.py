"""
Stage only the newest stamped outputs in reports/ for the next commit.

Run automatically by .githooks/pre-commit. It can also be run by hand:

    python tools/stage_latest_outputs.py

Input: the stamped output files on disk under reports/ and the git index.
Output: an updated git index (and possibly updated README.md /
docs/DETAILS.md), plus a one-line summary printed to the console.

Processing:
1. Finds the newest stamped version of every output in reports/.
2. Removes older stamped outputs from the index. They stay on disk.
3. Force-adds the newest files (stamped outputs are ignored by .gitignore).
4. Rewrites stamped output names in the docs (README.md, docs/DETAILS.md)
   to the newest stamps, so links and images point at committed files,
   and stages the changed docs.
