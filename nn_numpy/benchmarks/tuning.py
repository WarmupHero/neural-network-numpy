"""
Tune the TensorFlow (Keras) and PyTorch models' hyperparameters with Optuna.

Input: ``configs/tuning_experiments.json`` (search space, trials, seeds),
the training settings in ``configs/benchmark_experiments.json``, the main
experiment configs (architectures and seeds), and the raw data.

Output, per library:
- ``reports/benchmark_<library>_tuned_results_<stamp>.json``: the best
  configuration of each problem and architecture, trained and tested once
  on every seed's split. It has the same record format as the untuned
  benchmark results, so the comparison report reads it as one more library.
- ``reports/tuning_<library>_trials_<stamp>.json``: every tuning trial.

Run it with ``python -m nn_numpy.benchmarks.tuning [library ...]`` or
``make tune``. Without arguments every library in the tuning config is run.
