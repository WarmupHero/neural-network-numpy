"""
Train the library models on every problem and seed, and save the results.

Input: ``configs/benchmark_experiments.json`` (models and grids per
library), the main experiment configs (which seeds to run), and the raw
data in ``data/raw/``.
Output: ``reports/benchmark_<library>_results_<stamp>.json``, one record per
model configuration, problem and seed.

Run it with ``python -m nn_from_scratch.benchmarks.run [library ...]`` or
``make benchmarks``. Without arguments every library in the config is run.
