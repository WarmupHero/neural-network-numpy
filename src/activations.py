"""
Element-wise activation functions and a factory to create them by name.

Each activation class has forward(x), which applies the function to every
element, and backward(grad_output), which multiplies the incoming gradient
by the function's derivative (chain rule). Activations have no trainable
parameters; they only cache what backward() needs from forward().
