"""
Data access for the library comparisons.

Input: the experiment configs in ``configs/`` and the raw CSVs in
``data/raw/``.
Output: for a given problem and seed, exactly the same train / validation /
test split (and scaling) that the main NumPy pipeline uses, plus that
split's constant-prediction baseline.

Reusing the main pipeline's preprocessing, rather than re-implementing it,
guarantees that every library is trained and tested on identical data.
