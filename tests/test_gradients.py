    """
    Estimate the gradient of a scalar function by central finite differences.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : callable
        Function with no arguments that returns a scalar (float). It must
        read `x` (directly or through an object that holds it), so that
        changing `x` in place changes its result.
    x : numpy.ndarray of any shape, dtype float64
        Array to differentiate with respect to. It is modified in place
        during the computation and restored afterwards.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray of the same shape as x, dtype float64
        Estimated gradient df/dx.

    Notes
    -----
    Processing:
    1. Create a zero array `grad` shaped like x.
    2. For each element x[idx]:
       a. set it to original + EPS and evaluate f;
       b. set it to original - EPS and evaluate f;
       c. restore the original value;
       d. store (f_plus - f_minus) / (2 * EPS) in grad[idx].
    3. Return grad.

    The central difference has error of order EPS^2, which is much more
    accurate than the one-sided (f(x + eps) - f(x)) / eps. It costs two
    evaluations of f per element, so it is only used on small arrays.
