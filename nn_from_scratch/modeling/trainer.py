            Selects the metric: BCE for classification, MSE for regression.
        early_stopping : bool, default=False
            Whether to enable early stopping using validation-loss
            patience while also monitoring training loss as an
            overfitting signal.
        patience : int, default=10

              training data;
           b. for each mini-batch: forward pass, compute the loss,
              backward pass, measure the global gradient norm (and clip it

              norm to the history;
