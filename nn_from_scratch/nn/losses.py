"""
Loss functions used for training: MSE for regression, BCE for classification.

Each loss class has forward(y_true, y_pred), which returns the scalar loss
averaged over the batch, and backward(y_true, y_pred), which returns
dL/dy_pred, the gradient that starts backpropagation. get_loss() builds a
loss object from a config string.

    Mean Squared Error loss for regression.

    Notes
    -----
    Formula:
        MSE = (1 / n) * sum((y_true - y_pred)^2)

    This loss measures how far the predictions are from the true values.
    Larger errors are penalized more strongly because the difference is squared.

    This class provides:

    - forward pass: compute scalar loss
    - backward pass: compute dL/dy_pred

    The class has no state, so one object can be reused for any batch.

        Compute the Mean Squared Error loss.

        Parameters
        ----------
        y_true : numpy.ndarray of shape (batch_size, 1), dtype float64
            True target values.
        y_pred : numpy.ndarray of shape (batch_size, 1), dtype float64

        Notes

        Processing:

        1. Compute the element-wise error y_true - y_pred.
        2. Square it.
        3. Average over all elements with np.mean.

        For each sample:
            error = y_true - y_pred

        do not cancel each other out.

        Parameters
        ----------
        y_true : numpy.ndarray of shape (batch_size, 1), dtype float64
            True target values.
        y_pred : numpy.ndarray of shape (batch_size, 1), dtype float64

        Notes
        -----
        Processing:

        1. Take n = y_true.shape[0], the number of samples (rows).
        2. Return (2 / n) * (y_pred - y_true).

        For:
            L = (1/n) * sum((y_true - y_pred)^2)

        The derivative is:
            dL/dy_pred = (2/n) * (y_pred - y_true)

        n is the number of rows, so this matches forward() exactly when
        there is one output column, as in this project.

        This tells us how the loss changes if the prediction changes.

        If y_pred is too large:
            gradient is positive
            -> gradient descent will push prediction down

        If y_pred is too small:

        Parameters
        ----------
        y_true : numpy.ndarray of shape (batch_size, 1), dtype float64
            True binary labels, 0 or 1.

        Notes
        -----
        Processing:

        1. Clip y_pred to [1e-12, 1 - 1e-12] so log() never sees 0.
        2. Compute y_true * log(p) + (1 - y_true) * log(1 - p) for each
           element.
        3. Average with np.mean and negate.

        BCE compares:
        - the true class label
        - the predicted probability for that class

        It penalizes confident wrong predictions very strongly.

        Example:
        - if y_true = 1 and y_pred is close to 0, loss becomes very large
        - if y_true = 1 and y_pred is close to 1, loss is small

        Notes
        -----
        Processing:

        1. Clip y_pred to [1e-12, 1 - 1e-12] so the divisions below never
           divide by zero.
        2. Take n = y_true.shape[0], the number of samples (rows).

        This gradient tells us how changing the predicted probability
        affects the BCE loss.

        BCE expects probabilities, so y_pred should normally come from a
        sigmoid output layer.
