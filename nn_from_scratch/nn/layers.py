"""
Trainable and regularization layers for the from-scratch network.

This module defines the building blocks that sit between activations:

- Dense: a fully connected linear layer (Z = X @ W, optionally + b).
- BatchNorm: batch normalization with a learned scale and shift.
- Dropout: inverted dropout, active only in training mode.

Every layer exposes forward(X) and backward(grad_output). Layers with
trainable parameters also expose get_params(), get_grads() and
set_params(), which the optimizers and the early-stopping checkpoint use.

class Dense:
    """
    A fully connected (dense) layer with an optional bias term.

    This layer performs a linear transformation:

    Attributes
    ----------
    input_dim : int
        Number of input features the layer expects.
    output_dim : int
        Number of output neurons.
    use_bias : bool
        Whether the layer has a trainable bias.
    init : str
        Name of the weight initialization scheme that was used.
    weights : numpy.ndarray of shape (input_dim, output_dim), dtype float64
        Trainable weight matrix W.

    Notes
    -----
    Shape convention used in this project:

    - X: (batch_size, input_dim)
    - W: (input_dim, output_dim)
    - b: (1, output_dim), broadcast across the batch
    - Z: (batch_size, output_dim)

    The formula is often written as z = W x + b, which usually assumes
    x is a column vector. In this implementation, each sample is stored as
    a row, so the equivalent NumPy operation is X @ W + b.

    Why a bias matters: without a bias, every neuron computes a function
    that passes through the origin, so an all-zero input always produces
    an all-zero pre-activation. A bias lets each neuron shift its
    activation threshold. For ReLU this is what lets a neuron stay active
    (or become active again) when its weighted input is negative.

    Training vs evaluation: the layer behaves differently depending on
    self.training.

    - Training: mean and var come from the current batch, so every
      layer receives inputs on a consistent scale however much the
      earlier weights change. The layer also updates exponential
      moving averages of the batch statistics.
    - Evaluation: the moving averages are used instead. A prediction then
      depends only on its own input, and works for a single sample, whose
      own "batch variance" would be zero.

    The network's train() / eval() methods set the flag on every layer.

    Why a Dense bias is redundant before batch norm: subtracting the batch
    mean removes any constant added by the Dense layer's bias, so its
    gradient would always be zero. beta takes over the bias's job of
    shifting the activation.

        Processing:

        1. Compute dgamma and dbeta by summing over the batch and store
           them in self.dgamma and self.dbeta.
        2. Compute dx_hat = dL/dY * gamma.
        3. If the last forward() ran in evaluation mode, return
           dx_hat * inv_std.
        4. Otherwise return the full training-mode gradient below, which
           includes the paths through the batch mean and variance.

        Math: the parameter gradients sum over the batch, because gamma
        and beta are shared by every sample:

            dL/dgamma = sum_i dL/dY_i * x_hat_i
            dL/dbeta  = sum_i dL/dY_i

        In training mode, mean and var are themselves functions of every
        sample in the batch, so each input affects every output. Applying
        the chain rule through x_hat, var and mean and simplifying gives:

            dx_hat = dL/dY * gamma
            dL/dX  = (inv_std / N) * (N * dx_hat
                                      - sum(dx_hat)
                                      - x_hat * sum(dx_hat * x_hat))

        The two subtracted terms are the gradient flowing back through the
        batch mean and the batch variance. In evaluation mode the
        statistics are constants, so dL/dX is simply dx_hat * inv_std.

        The branch is chosen by cached_training (the mode used in the last
        forward()), not by the current training flag, so the gradient
        always matches the forward computation it differentiates.

class Dropout:
    """
    Inverted dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014).

    During training, each input value is set to zero with probability
    `rate`, using a fresh random mask for every batch. The values that
    survive are divided by (1 - rate):

        mask = (random >= rate) / (1 - rate)
        Y    = X * mask

    Attributes
    ----------
    rate : float
        Probability of dropping each value, in [0, 1).
    random : numpy.random.RandomState or module numpy.random
        Generator used to draw the masks.
    training : bool
        True in training mode, False in evaluation mode.
    mask : numpy.ndarray of shape (batch_size, num_features), dtype float64, or None
        Scaled mask from the last training-mode forward pass (entries are
        0 or 1 / (1 - rate)), or None when the layer passed X through.

    Notes
    -----
    Why it regularizes: a neuron can't rely on any particular neighbour
    being present, so the network has to spread what it learns across
    many neurons instead of building fragile co-adapted features. Each
    batch effectively trains a different thinned sub-network.

    Why the survivors are scaled up ("inverted" dropout): with rate 0.2,
    only about 80% of the values reach the next layer, so its input sum
    would be about 80% of what it sees when nothing is dropped. Dividing
    the survivors by 0.8 keeps the expected value the same, so evaluation
    can use the plain network with no adjustment.

    Training vs evaluation:

    - Training: random mask, as above.
    - Evaluation: the layer does nothing (Y = X), so predictions are
      deterministic.

    The network's train() / eval() methods set the flag on every layer.
