"""
Print the list of Makefile commands with their descriptions (used by ``make help``).

Input: the path of a Makefile, given as the first command-line argument.
Output: one line per documented target, printed to the console.

A target is documented by a ``## description`` comment line above it. Lines
between the comment and the target (such as ``.PHONY: name``) are skipped.
Keeping this logic in Python, rather than inside the Makefile, means it works
the same whether make runs its recipes with sh or with Windows cmd.exe.

    Find each documented target and its description in a Makefile.

    Parameters
    ----------
    makefile_text : str
        The full contents of the Makefile.

    Returns
    -------
    list of tuple of (str, str)

    Notes
    -----
    Processing:
    1. Walk the lines in order.
    2. When a line starts with "## ", remember the rest of it as the
       pending description.
    3. When a later line matches TARGET_PATTERN while a description is
       pending, record (target, description) and clear the pending one.
       Lines in between, such as ``.PHONY: name``, are ignored.
