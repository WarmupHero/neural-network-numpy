"""
Experiment driver: runs the full hyperparameter sweep for both problems.

Input: the two JSON experiment configs in configs/ and the datasets in
datasets/ (downloaded first if missing).

Processing: for each problem (banknote classification, energy-efficiency
regression) and each seed, the data is preprocessed once, then one network
is trained and tested for every combination of architecture, optimizer,
learning rate and batch size listed in the config.

Output: a console summary table, plus two files in report/ whose names
carry the run stamp: a compact CSV summary and a full JSON file with every
run's settings, metrics and training histories (read by src/analysis.py and
the plotting scripts).

    Parameters
    ----------

    dataset_splits : tuple of numpy.ndarray

    Why these constants: the class proportion is the best constant
    probability under BCE, and the mean is the best constant under MSE.
