Aggregate analysis of the experiment sweep, written as a plain-text report.

Input: a full-results JSON written by nn_numpy.modeling.train (reports/main_results_full_<stamp>.json,
the newest one by default, or a path given on the command line).

Processing: adds derived values to every run (best validation loss, final
training loss, training-loss convergence epoch), then summarizes the runs by
optimizer and by architecture, per problem and combined across problems, to
answer three questions: which optimizer converges fastest, which reaches the
best loss, and how depth affects optimization. Extra sections cover the A2
variants (bias, He initialization, batch normalization), dropout, and, when
several seeds were run, mean ± standard deviation across seeds.

Output: reports/analysis_<stamp>.txt.

    relative_tolerance : float, default=0.01

    Notes

       checkpoint that early stopping restored, i.e. of the model whose
       test metric is reported. Only if it is missing, fall back to the
       minimum of the validation-loss history.
    2. final_train_loss = last value of the training-loss history.
    3. convergence_epoch = convergence_epoch(train_loss_history).
    4. generalization_gap = test_metric - train_metric, if train_metric is
       recorded. A large positive gap means overfitting.
    5. For older results files: derive stop_reason from the "diverged" and
       "stopped_early" flags, and set overfitting_epochs to None (not
       recorded).

    Why not always use the minimum of the history: early stopping only
    saves a checkpoint when the validation loss improves by more than
    min_delta. A later epoch can reach a slightly lower validation loss
    without being saved, so that minimum can belong to a model that was
    never tested. Selecting runs on it would pick a run for a score its
    reported model did not achieve.

    problem_runs : list of dict
        All runs of one problem, from every seed, with derived metrics added
        (see add_derived_metrics). Each needs "architecture", "stop_reason",
        "overfitting_epochs" (int or None), "best_val_loss" and

    digits : int
        Decimal places used for the generalization gap.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        A formatted multi-line string with one row per architecture: how
        many runs ended by early stopping, at the maximum number of epochs
        or by diverging; how many early-stopped runs showed the overfitting
        signature when they stopped; and the generalization gap (test minus
        train metric) of the run selected per seed, as mean ± std. Ends with
        a blank line.

    Notes

    Processing, for each architecture (same order as the architecture
    table; others are not shown):
    1. Count the runs per stop reason.
    2. Among the early-stopped runs, count those with overfitting_epochs > 0,
       i.e. whose training loss was still improving while the validation
       loss was not. Older results files don't record it ("n/a").
    3. Per seed, select the best run by validation loss and report the mean
       ± std of its generalization gap.

    The overfitting count uses the trainer's min_delta as the size of a
    meaningful improvement, so runs whose losses are already far below
    min_delta can't show the signature; the gap covers those.
